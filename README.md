# Advent of Code ![Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/favicon.ico)

Working through past Advent of Code problems starting all the way from 2015, in a mixture of Python and R, and maybe a few different languages as I learn them

This repository contains my solutions to the problems on [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/), an annual series of programming challenges that are released every day in December.

## What is Advent of Code?

Advent of Code is an event that provides a series of daily programming challenges, starting on December 1st and ending on December 25th. Each challenge focuses on algorithmic problems that test your coding skills, problem-solving abilities, and understanding of data structures. The problems range from simple puzzles to complex, multi-part challenges.

## What’s in this Repository?

In this repository, you’ll find:
- Solutions to the daily problems from Advent of Code.
- Most problems are solved in Python, but may switch to other languages (e.g., C, Ruby) for performance or preference.
- The solutions are organized by year and day (e.g., `2024/01`, `2024/02`).
- Each day's folder contains a primary solution script (e.g., `YearDay01.py`, `YearDay02.py`), with alternative or older methods saved as `AltYearDay01.py`, `AltYearDay02.py`, etc.
- Each year folder also contains a `Run_2024.py` script that runs all the primary solutions for that year, and generates a runtime plot stored in the corresponding `README_2024.md`.
