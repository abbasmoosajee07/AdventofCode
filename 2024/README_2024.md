# Advent of Code 2024 - Coding Challenge Summaries

This repository contains coding solutions for the 2024 Advent of Code. Its the first time I am doing one as it is released so should be interesting

## Day-by-Day Coding Overview

1. **Day 1- Historian Hysteria**: *Ruby* | Sort number lists and count their differences. Pretty simple overall, provided i didn't make reading mistakes, but life goes on
2. **Day 2- Red-Nosed Reports** *Julia* | Validate number lists according to different criteria, Part 1 was simple, complicated Part 2 way too much initially.
3. **Day 3- Mull It Over**: *Python* | Used regex to find presence of all valid multiples, and then evaluate them. Seemed complicated originally until, you calm down and think of a clearer approach
4. **Day 4- Ceres Search**: *Python* | Used a bfs type search to create a word search algorithm in a letter grid. Adapted some Everybody Codes Quest code for this and then converted that to ruby
5. **Day 5- Print Queue**: *Julia* | Validating lists of numbers to match a set of rules, Fairly simple Part 1, Part 2 felt complicated until I looked at the megathread and found a different approach
6. **Day 6- Guard Gallivant**: *Ruby* | Pretty simple question overall with regards to the logic, but optimising it proved to be a fun challenge
7. **Day 7- Bridge Repair**: *Ruby* | Various permutations to build a target number with different blocks using the operators '+','*' and then '||'. Pretty simple once I realised i didn't have to permutate through all the operators
8. **Day 8- Resonant Collinearity**: *Ruby* | Find antinodes for any given antenna, Weird Wording which made the question really hard to understand
9. **Day 9- Disk Fragmenter**: ** | Free up disk space by removing empty space and rearranging files.
